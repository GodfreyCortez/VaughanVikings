# VaughanVikings

This was created as a final project for a high school computer science course. It was developed for a Vaughan Vikings baseball coach and is solely for his use only. It uses the Xamarin framework and is thus compatible with Android, iOS, and Windows 10 UWP. Please note that these versions were not specifically tailored to each type of device as the client only required Android. Cross platform compatibility is a proof of concept and is in no way a final product. This app is not meant for sale or to be used except for clients in which it is intended for.
